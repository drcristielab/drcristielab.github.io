excerpt: 'This study examined how instructors and students at a Minority-Serving Institution perceived supports and barriers during the sudden shift to emergency remote teaching (ERT) during COVID-19. The research found that both groups identified more barriers than supports, highlighting issues like technological challenges and mental health strain, and emphasized the need for better institutional communication and resource access to support future emergency transitions.'
